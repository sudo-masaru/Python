#2: changing variable type.
    #x = 4 #x is originally int
    #x = "Sally" #x is now a type of string
    
#3: [CASTING]: to specify a data type of a variable
    #x = str(3) # x will be '3'
    #y = int(3) #y will be 3
    #z = float(3) #z will be 3.0
    #print(x, " ", y, " ", z)
    
#4. [TYPE]: getting the type of a variable
    #x = int(3)
    #print("x is a type of:",type(x)) #type is int
    
#5. [SINGLE or DOUBLE QUOTES?]: String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes.
    #(x = "suzu") """ <- is the same as -> """; (x = 'suzu')
    
#6. [CASE SENSITIVITY]: Variable names are case-sensitive.
    # a = 4
    # A = "suzu"
    #A will not overwrite a
