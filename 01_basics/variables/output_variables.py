#The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
    # x = 'python is awsome'; print(x)
    
#In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
    #x, y ,z = 'python', 'is', 'awsome'; print(x,y,z)
    
#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
    #x, y ,z = 'python', 'is', 'awsome'; print(x+y+z)
    #Notice the space character after "Python " and "is ", without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome".


#In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:
    # x = 5
    # y = 'suzu'
    # print(x+y)
    
# The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
    # x = 5
    # y = 'suzu'
    # print(x,y)
