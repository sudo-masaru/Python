#Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line.

#EXAMPLE 1:
    # Note: Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.
        # x, y, z = "orange", "banana", "cherry"
        # print(x , y, z)
        
#2. [UNPACK A COLLECTION]: If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.
    #Unpack a list
    # fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    # x, y, z = fruits 
    # print(x , y, z)
